# Cybersecurity & GRC Portfolio

This repository serves as a curated portfolio of hands-on cybersecurity and governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) projects.

The projects focus on:
- Security control implementation
- Vulnerability identification and remediation
- NIST SP 800-53 and CIS control mapping
- Audit-ready documentation and evidence

Each project mirrors real-world security analyst and GRC workflows.
